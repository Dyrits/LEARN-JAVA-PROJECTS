### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
The genome of an organism stores all the genetic information necessary to build and maintain that organism. It is an organism’s complete set of DNA.

[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as:
- `A`: Adenine
- `C`: Cytosine
- `G`: Guanine
- `T`: Thymine

![alt-text](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/string-methods/dna.png)

So a strand of DNA could look something like `ACGAATTCCG`.

Write a DNA.java program that determines whether there is a protein in a strand of DNA.

A protein has the following qualities:
- It begins with a “start codon”: `ATG`.
- It ends with a “stop codon”: `TGA`.
- In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.

So for example:
- `ATGCGATACTGA` is a protein because it has the start codon ATG, the stop codon TGA, and the length is divisible by 3.
- `ATGCGATAGA` is not a protein because the sequence length is not divisible by 3, so the third condition is not satisfied.
