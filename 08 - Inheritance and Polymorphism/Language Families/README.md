### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
Languages, just like people, often have families. You can even map language lineage a bit like a family tree.

Java can help us build a model to track inherited traits across families. In this case, we’ll focus on something that often varies between language families: word order — where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

For example, in English, you would use subject-verb-object order: 

subject  | verb | object
--- | --- | ---
She | eats | noodles

But in Japanese, you would use subject-object-verb order:  

subject  | verb | object
--- | --- | ---
彼女は | 麺を | 食べる
(she) | (noodles) | (eats)

Your **Language Inheritance** package has three Java files:
- **Language.java**: for the `Language` parent class, which serves as the template for all languages.
- **Mayan.java**: for `Mayan`, a child class of `Language` modeled after the [Mayan language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_languages).
- **SinoTibetan.java**: for `SinoTibetan`, a child class of `Language` modeled after the [Sino-Tibetan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages) family.

Build out a Java package with these classes to model real-world language families.
