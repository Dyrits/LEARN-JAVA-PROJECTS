### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
In this project, you will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:  
- Add two integers   
- Subtract two integers  
- Multiply two integers  
- Divide two integers  
- Apply the modulo operator on two integers  

The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to explore more in the learning environment.

**Important**: Moving forward, all projects will require that you define the `main` method manually. When you click the “Save” button below, an attempt to run your Java code is made. However, Java will return an error if you attempt to run a Java program without first defining a `main` method. If you encounter such an error, do not worry, you can define the `main` method ahead of time in order to avoid seeing the error.
