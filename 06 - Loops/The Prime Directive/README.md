### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
Finding prime numbers is a common technical challenge in programming interviews.

As it happens, Java loops are a great tool to help you do this!

A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.

Your prime directive: Build a **PrimeDirective.java** program that creates an `ArrayList` of all prime numbers in an array.
