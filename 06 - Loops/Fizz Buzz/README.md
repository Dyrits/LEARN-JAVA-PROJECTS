### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a common developer interview question; so common it’s almost cliché!

The challenge is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve coding problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:
- For multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead of the number.
- For the multiples of 5, print `Buzz`.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.  

Happy coding!
