### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
In this project, we’ll use Java to write a [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:  
- A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).  
- Words from the player to fill in those blanks.  

“Roses are Red” poem example:

For this project, we have provided the story, but it will be up to you to complete the following:  
- Create all the variables needed for the story.  
- Print the story with the variables in the right places.  

Let’s begin!
